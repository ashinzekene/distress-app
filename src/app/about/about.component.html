    In Nigeria, many people go through problems, issues and injustices such as rape, 
    domestic violence, robbery, molestation and other issues such as motor accidents. 
    These people most times are unable to voice out their problems for reasons such
    as fear of being mocked upon, and mostly the “inadequacies” and lack of comeliness 
    of the police.

    <br>
    This app helps solve that challenge by giving you a voice. It serves as a medium 
    to report such cases. We hope that very soon security agents would be able to use 
    information gathered from this platform to trace criminals and bring them to justice
